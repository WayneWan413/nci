==================

This project derived from the chinesecloud.net system, first text mining system developped by Daoming Liu and Jing Wu in mid 2011.

Lot things changed in last three years, so we decided to create a new project.

This project uses existing work from [Daoming Liu][l1]

Usage
==================
To use this project you'll need [**Express**][exp] & [**Jade**][jade]. Installation of all dependencies is handled via npm:

	npm install

Configuration can be done by modifying the *app.js* & *routes/index.js* files.

The footer can be modified by changing *views/inc/footer.jade*.
